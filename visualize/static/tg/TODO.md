### TODO:

- Read up on how to handle users logged in and users not logged in, in the web app context.
- Split the app.js file into fragments.
- Setup simple test cases for the controllers (and directives?).
- Make the password filter more generic (since it only checks for length, max-length="8" directive would be better).
- Make the field content comparison filter generic.
- Create TODO list for the actual web app.
