### TODO:

- Start topics page
- Figure out how to make popover appear for analyses
- Make navbar menus and menu items activate depending on location (use $location)

- Read up on how to handle users logged in and users not logged in, in the web app context.
- Setup simple test cases for the controllers (and directives).
- Make the password filter more generic (since it only checks for length, min-length="8" directive would be better).
- Make the field content comparison filter generic.
