    <p>
      The <span style="color: green">Topic</span>al Guide is a web tool developed to help you explore your corpora through topic modeling.
      Click on the "Datasets" tab to get started, then select a dataset (this is your corpus, or collection of text documents) and an analysis (the result of running a topic model on your corpus).
      Once you do that start exploring!

      Some visualizations need additional explanation to use them to their full extent.
